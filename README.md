# PROJECT-TRAVELER
A project which generates and manipulates Location names and data in an interesting and interactive manner.

This project is a kind of digital desk toy at the moment. 
Its purpose is to:
take commands from the user,
generate novel location names and eventually location descriptions,
And it then add them to a log which,
in the future, the user can save to a text file.

I am still working on it every now and then.
